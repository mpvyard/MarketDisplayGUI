 
Here’s the writeup on the programming exercise.  The GUI’s should be in WPF .  Document any assumptions you make etc.
Also, if you have any questions let me know. I wouldn’t worry about cases like crossing bid/ask markets. Expect that the bid prices
Will always be less than the ask prices.
 
 
Description
 
 
The goal of this project to write a simple market display GUI, which responds to
prices and order messages and displays them as shown in the accompanied graphic.
 
- The program should open a socket and listen for connections.
- Popup GUI for chosing IP address & port
- Clients (in the case our test program) will connect to the socket
  and send order and price messages. The format of the messages is follows:
  Its a line of characters ending with a newline and within each line the columns/fields
  are separated by a ":".
 
price messages have the following format. 
 
messagetype:SYMBOL:Action:BidAskType:PRICE:QTY
 
for example
 
PRICE:IBM:ADD:BID:100:23
PRICE:IBM:ADD:ASK:101:34
 
PRICE:IBM:MODIFY:ASK:101:67
PRICE:IBM:DELETE:ASK:101:0
 
3 types of actions are possible:
 
ADD, DELETE and MODIFY
 
An Add of either Bid or Ask, should show the appropriate quantity in the bid or order size
column of the appropriate price row. Similarly modifying a qty at a certain bid price or ask price
should show the new quanyity at that location. Deleting a bid or ask price should clear out the 
bid or ask quantity from that column.
 
 
The order messages have the following format:
 
 
ORDER:IBM:ADD:BID:100:11
ORDER:IBM:DELETE:ASK:102:0
ORDER:IBM:MODIFY:BID:100:13
 
Order should be show in the corresponding price row and column. Deleting an order
Should clear out that cell.
 
When a new price or order updates a cell, flash that cell with color (your choice of color) for a second.
